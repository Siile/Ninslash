# Welcome to GunGame!
#
# Quick intro to the gamemode:
# - You always have just one weapon
# - Every kill replaces it by the next one
# - Every death replaces it by the previous one
#
# The goal is to reach the last weapon, which is the sword. Get a kill with it to win.
#
# Additional tips:
# - When you get a kill your health will be refilled
# - Ammo can be refilled by picking up crates or your current weapon
# - You can only pickup the weapon that you may hold according to your score
#
# Good luck and Have fun!
